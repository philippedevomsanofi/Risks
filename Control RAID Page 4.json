It was mainly noticed in Australia with both patients using home nursing services since January2022. Also, some challenges were reported from the other countries as France and UK. In Australia, several issues are still ongoing, including using of incorrect kits, collection of non-enough sample volume for lab analysis, incorrect blood taken, source documents are provided to sites with long delay.   ","Impact":"High","Outcome":" For Australia :    The issues were communicated with the vendor by emails and during regular meeting in order to put in place corrective actions to resolve these issues however no improved was noticed. A first escalation was done on 19FEB2022 to Home nursing services Expert and a meeting was conducted on the 09MAR2022 with Home nursing services expert , Accellacare management team , GSMs and local team. Several Solutions were proposed during this meeting (GPM who oversight AU to be changed from EU to US in order to shorten the source document review time, new country study managers to be added in AU, and they are identifying new nurses)  a new GPM in US was assigned to Australia-(MAR2022)   new country study manager is added- Handover completed 08APR2022,back up country study manager is added on 12APR2022   still pending to identify new nurses (Several months have been took to search a new nurse without any improvement)   Retraining the actual nurse- last training performed on 12APR2022 & continuous check with the country study manager during the visit to avoid any new mistake.    ﻿New nurse for pt036000100003 has been identified and begin performing visit on 6May   New Issue:    HP forgot to provide the test kit to Home Nurse on visit on 13May for pt.036000100003, which lead to pregnancy testing result missing on that visit   On week19 for pt.036000100003, the accession number on the sample labels does not match the accession number on the LRF. The new nurse Sheryl accidentally mixed up the LRF and/or tubes/tube labels in the kit. (new nurse)   the nurse inadvertently entered Site number 036000 1  as the Site number on the Week 29 LRF for subject 0360002-00001 instead of 036000 2 (actual nurse)   New pt#2 nurse arrived the first week of May and phoned the SC asking where source worksheets were, it's HP's responsibility , not site staff       Following this slight improvement, local team reported new critical issues to Global team which impacting patient's safety:   IMP injection done with no dosing approval from investigator (FEB2022)  The reportable adverse events were not reported, including injection site reaction (DEC2021- MAR2022, TBC if it is still ongoing in APR2022).   Additional labs requested to be completed due to kidney function concerns, however the nurse didn't complete it which resulted in skipping 2 IMP doses for patient 036000100003 ( 05APR2022)     A second escalation was reported on 31MAR2022 to Home nursing services Expert as the situation is getting more and more critical as well as an escalation to CSO-PL.     A Corrective action needs to be implemented ASAP at vendor level to ensure patients safety and to avoid the occurrence of any additional issues. Also to note, that this issues are time consuming for Local team and site staff impacting other study activities.     For other Countries:    It was noticed that the delay to provide source documents to study sites had an impact on SDV activities to be done by CRAs for Futility analysis. Accellacare only clarify the standard process, no reason and CAPA provided. Back-up Nurse: Always an issue to find a back-up nurse, however in the contract, each patient should have a back-up nurse already identified.

Shorter recruitment period endorsed by the project team before the countries' feedback.   Added on 12 may 22 : Main impacted countries : Poland (initial target 8 patients decreased to 3), Argentina (initial target 9 patients), Australia (initial target 4 patients decreased to 2).        Covid situation :    could slow-down or prevent patient's recruitment in some countries : site ressources impacted, hospitals or clinics closed, patients afraid to go to hospitals/clinics.  central lab - human ressources and material shortage HA/ EC : delay in approval in some coutries (ex : Mexico ; India).

During agreement discussions, the publisher (Wiley), who is representing the copyright holder, refused to add a debarment clause in the contract or to sign a debarment certification.    The reason given by the publisher (the licensee) is the following : “(…) we continue to believe that fundamentally the issue of debarment isn’t relevant as the GELP Score was not created by JWS Inc, or any employee or affiliate, but by specialists who chose to publish their work in our journal. We believe that it might apply, if you were obtaining a license directly from an institution at which such an author were employed, but we don’t have any personnel records relating to any of our authors. (…)We cannot be held responsible if there is an issue with an author’s work and we are not informed of it by his or her institution. We also note that this has not previously been raised by Sanofi in any other deal or context, which is what leads us to think that there’s a misunderstanding of Wiley’s role as the publisher, not the developer, of the tool, underpinning this concern. ”    In light of these explainations and after discussion with QA department, the licensing agreement will be approved without this clause documented in the contract or in another statement. "},"Other Information":{"Category":"","Approvers":[{"name":"Anaelle Vaucher-ext","type":"User"},{"name":"Tristan Connesson-ext","type":"User"},{"name":"Janina Jezierski","type":"User"}],"studies":["ACT16404"],"Regions":["Central"],"Roadmaps":["Central"]}}},{"name":"OHIP-14 US American version used on the e-CRF","createdAt":"2021-02-04T16:54:20.803Z","createdBy":"Almeras Nadine","lastUpdatedAt":"2022-02-17T16:16:02.592Z","lastUpdatedBy":"Rassat-ext Christelle","closeDate":"2024-12-03T11:59:16.151Z","closedBy":"Super Admin","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Decision Status":{"Status":"Closed","Date of decision":"2021-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","Escalated":"No"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Decision Description":"When designing the Clin RO (Clinician Reported Outcome) the study team realized that Original (copyrighted) version of OHIP is in Australian English.

monitoring plan  For recruitment purpose    Not applicable because enrollment is competitive        For monitoring purpose     There is a strategy to mitigate the risk of over enrollment and to ensure high quality data will be implemented and to drive the monitoring activities. For this purpose, a cap approval process will be defined as default in the IRT system and must be adapted based on the recruitment rate per site: For the screening cap: - Study level:160  - Site level: 8     For the randomization cap: - Study level: 120  - Site level: 4     The site values can be adapted individually. There are 4 cap alerts at study level for screening and randomization at 50% , 75%, 90% and 100% of total effective. At site level, the alerts sent are when screening and randomization caps are met only.   COMMENT: in case the site screened more and the site arrived at the cap increase process --> we should be alerted.      Process for Cap increase      When a site approaches the randomize cap and if the site wishes to continue the patient recruitment beyond the cap, the Site Monitor should start the process of site assessment in order to determine whether the site is allowed to continue the enrolment. Cap assessment process will be started when a site has  3  patients randomized  (IRT alert notification should be triggered)  or earlier  as per local team judgment to allow enough time to complete the process.    At least one monitoring visit (on-site or remote) should have been done at a site before the 1st step (local assessment) is initiated. As a general reminder 1 week is the timeline allowed per SOP to complete the first step. The decision is reached jointly in two steps; assessment and approval first at local and then at global level using the  Appendix 2 “Checklist for Approval to Increase/Continue Subject Enrolment at a Clinical Study Site”  (RDSD-000294).

However, due to a misplaced comma, the SOA table footnote z (since PA03, Nov 2023) implies that archival samples are optional upon participant agreement: \"This sample will be collected and stored for use if any unexpected safety issue arises, to ensure that a post-baseline value is available for previously unassessed parameters (e.g., serology) and for biomarker research, if agreed by the participant. “ Section 2 of the ICF includes information regarding optional blood samples collected from patients who provide consent for their collection, but  the collection of archival  samples in case of a safety issue was not mentioned in this section, as this sample collection is mandatory and not optional.       Based on the thoughtful risk-taking approach recommended by the TMU management, the team has decided that no amendment is needed at this time because this omission does not pose any safety risk to study participants nor violates their rights. Decision was also made that the archival blood samples will continue to be collected until the end of the study, at which time they will be discarded. The CPQM reminded the team that in the current ICF,  even if the samples seem to be covered in the SOA through the “Blood sampling for safety and effects of frexalimab” in part A and “Blood samples” in Part B,  in the section dedicated to the blood samples, only chemistry, blood cell measurement and serology, measurement of the levels of the study drug, and biomarker measurements are defined. No item regarding any safety parameters is described. The CPQM reminded the team that the use of archival samples for safety purposes should be clarified to patients. That is the reason why the CPQM was in favor to update the ICF immediately. The majority of the study team members decided based on the no risk to the study participants to clarify the safety purpose of collecting archival blood samples during the next protocol and ICF amendment.      Attendees  :   1.      Stephane Saubadu   2.      Biljana Djukic   3.      Brendan Smyth   4.      Anais Cransac   5.      Delphine Roche   6.      Pinar Kanlikilicer "},"Other Information":{"Category":"Others","Approvers":[{"name":"Saubadu Stephane","type":"User"},{"name":"CRANSAC-ext Anais","type":"User"},{"name":"Roche Delphine","type":"User"},{"name":"Kanlikilicer Pinar","type":"User"}],"studies":["ACT16877"],"Regions":["Central"],"Roadmaps":["Central"]}}},{"name":"IV infusion: 100 ml or 108 ml administration","createdAt":"2025-09-12T14:35:16.536Z","createdBy":"Dacremont Mathilde","lastUpdatedAt":"2025-09-12T14:36:48.138Z","lastUpdatedBy":"Dacremont Mathilde","closeDate":"2025-09-12T14:35:16.535Z","closedBy":"Dacremont Mathilde","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Decision Status":{"Status":"Closed","Date of decision":"2024-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","Escalated":"No"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Decision Description":"For IV infusion, it has been noticed that some sites reports in eCRF an infusion of 100 ml or 108 ml (different between site and sometimes between visits on same site).  This difference seems to be due to Pharmacy manual not being clear enough : Some sites are adding 8 ml of IMP into 100ml saline bag, and other are removing 8ml of saline solution before adding the 8 ml of IMP in the saline bag.  Statistical team and PK team confirmed there is no impact on their side as the volume of IMP injected is still the same (8ml), and the concentration can still be calculated.

In order to ensure the validity of this device data.    Meeting on 19kJan2021:   After an initial discussion among the different attendees, a few action plans were proposed:         Ask procurement (Kim Thalheimer) to contact the Martin Vigorimeter manufacturer to see if they would agree to apply for a license from Health Canada. The process to receive a license from Health Canada would take 30 days  CTA Regulatory Affairs Manager can submit an Investigational Testing Application (ITA) to Health Canada. However, that process can potentially take up to several months. CTA Regulatory Affairs Manager can contact Health Canada to request a waiver but we do not know how long this process can be. CTA Regulatory Affairs Manager can contact Health Canada and more specifically the “Medical Device License Bureau” to ask them in which class to classify the Martin Vigorimeter (class-I or class-II device).     CPL explains that option A) has already been implemented since Friday Jan 15th, 2021 as he already asked procurement to follow-up with the manufacturer.     Sanofi’s Director of Global Regulatory Affairs suggests to go with option D) first. The rationale is that we are not 100% certain as to which class the Martin Vigorimeter belongs to. Once we have an answer from Health Canada, then we can implement the correct action plan (i.e. a license is not necessary for class-I medical devices). This idea is also supported by the CROMs. As a result, it was confirmed that Sanofi’s Director of Global Regulatory Affairs will provide some information such as a description of the device and its intent of use for PDY16744 to our CTA Regulatory Affairs Manager to contact Health Canada (Medical Device License Bureau). Sanofi’s Director of Global Regulatory Affairs provided this information on January 18, 2021.     CPL agrees to re-contact procurement to ask them to hold off with contacting the manufacturer. CPL did so later on January 18, 2021 and procurement confirmed later on that same day that they did not contact the manufacturer yet and that they will remain on stand-by until further notice.     All attendees agree that once we receive an answer from Health Canada that we will organize a meeting to re-assess the situation.      Action Plan:          Option D) to be implemented for now    "},"Other Information":{"Category":"Regulatory Affairs","Owners":[{"name":"Thomas Rolain","type":"User"},{"name":"Solene ENGEL","type":"User"}],"studies":["PDY16744"],"Regions":["North America"],"Roadmaps":[]}}},{"name":"National Submmission for Europeans Countires in case of VHP failed","createdAt":"2020-12-02T13:58:09.035Z","createdBy":"ENGEL Solene","lastUpdatedAt":"2020-12-14T16:01:18.067Z","lastUpdatedBy":"Manifacier-Taton Fanny","closeDate":"2020-12-14T16:00:44.916Z","closedBy":"Manifacier-Taton Fanny","linkedItems":[{"category":"Issues","name":"VHP submission failed"},{"category":"Actions","name":"Regulatory timelines for CTA package and VHP TBC"}],"discussions":[{"comment":"Update 14DEC: VHP accepted - only FR and NL will go through national submission process","commentedBy":"Manifacier-Taton Fanny","commentedAt":"2020-12-14T16:01:13.035Z"}],"fields":{"Action Status":{"Status":"Completed","Escalated":"No","Reviewed":"not reviewed"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Action Description":"Preparation of the National Submmission for Europeans Countries in case of VHP failed","Due Date":"","Outcome":"RA:GSMs regular calls , 02Dec2020  :  Wainting the VHP feedback for Approval/rejection.

(others medic) should be mentioned for the HA submission.","Due Date":"2021-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","Outcome":" 04 Dec20:   I would summarize the situation of vaccines in Serbia, the risk/mitigation and the strategy that we would put in place to try to do our best to respect the commitment for this study.     As per clarification received by CSD and CRD while reviewing protocol requirement with Medical Advisor, it was confirmed that the following Vaccination requirement apply: Meningococcus serogroup B and MenC-ACYW are requested by protocol and need to be administered.  PCV13 + PPSV23 if there are no specific SoC/site guidelines indication these need to be administered both. HIB administration is Optional     During the site qualification visit was discussed with all Investigators the protocol requirement on vaccination documentation within 5 years form enrollment  “I 04. General requirements for all groups:   Documented vaccinations against encapsulated bacterial pathogens given within 5 years of enrollment or initiated a minimum of 14 days prior to first dose as specified in  Section 6.8.1 .” or in case of absence of that documentation, according to section 6.8.1 the following requirement was also reviewed:  “If a participant does not have documented vaccination against encapsulated bacterial pathogens (Neisseria meningitidis, including serogroup B meningococcus [where available], Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) within 5 years prior to enrollment, vaccination must be initiated as early as possible during the Screening period prior to enrollment.” All Investigators confirmed that  those vaccination s  are not part of SoC for study patient population and that is expected that all patient eligible for protocol will require vaccination at screening .    So it was also explained to Investigators that according to protocol where no regional guidelines are available for patients with persistent complement deficiency, it is recommended that vaccinations should include meningococcal conjugate, meningococcal serogroup B, 13-valent pneumococcal, 23-valent pneumococcal, and Haemophilus influenza Type b vaccines, where commercially available. Investigators already confirmed that  they do see the benefit of these vaccination and are in agreement with performing these vaccinations during screening period   in alignment with the protocol. It was also confirmed that the vaccines need to be supplied by the Sponsor since some of these vaccines are not available/not registered in Serbia.       We started to try a way to source these vaccines from a market outside Serbia since it was also confirmed that: the vaccination will be considered as “Non IMP” In the study CTA form Per Serbian Local regulation the vaccines will be reported as “Other medicine” that will be used for the trial, that include any non-IMP, non-placebo products, including comparators, rescue medication, SoC (sometimes HA or EC can request SOC is provided by the Sponsor) and “other medicines” needed to be provided for successful clinical trial conduct. Sponsor are allowed to import “Other Medication” in Serbia for clinical study purpose All Vaccines will be dosed as per leaflet and no additional instructions will be provided by the Sponsor other than the one already in the protocol.   Considering that HIB is not available in Serbia and that is considered optional and there are no local regulation nor SoC that could apply according also to Medical Advisor (as discussed with CSD/CRD) was agreed to   no supply this vaccine.        Based on all the above we approached our Italian Vendor asking for a clinical supply of  Meningococcus serogroup B and MenC-ACYW.  PCV13 + PPSV23.  our Italian Vendor confirmed that:   we can receive coverage for Meningococcus serogroup B and MenC-ACYW  there is a shortage of PCV13 + PPSV23 at least till Jan2021 related to Pandemic situation. On Jan 2021 a new check need to be done to see if PCV13 + PPSV23 are again available and if we can ensure coverage for these Vaccines for our study.   This shortage of Vaccines seem to be a global shortage caused by Pandemic and it could delay our submission strategy.     Do you have the same feedback from other countries? To mitigate this risk, could you please help us to identify another country in the study without vaccine shortage that we can contact to have information about their local vendor that we could use to import vaccine? Could you please confirm me that the global provisioning of vaccines have not been reconsidered?     Having all above considerations in mind, and considering that submission deadline is around 15 December, We would share with you our strategy that is to take the risk to proceed with submission even if probably we will not have the confirmation of vaccines availability within 15 December and proceed to investigate the possibility to find a local vendor providing the vaccines in other countries different from Italy and Serbia and in paralle follow up with Italian vendor to see if the shortage in Italy will be resolved in January.     If we will not succeed to find vaccines, this will have a financial Impact because we will need to pay for HA/CEC application and this included Fees of HA / CEC but also cost comes from CRO involved for activities in Serbia (in Total about 33.500 you can see details and estimation in LSCR).    Probably if we will not able to find vaccines also in the other countries, there will be an impact at the study level for all countries and the evaluation will be done at global level.

An expert in the field, Dr. Luis Querol, raises some concerns about Western blot (hight false positive) and his lab uses another technology: Immunofluorescence. His lab is in the Neuromuscular Diseases Unit of the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (Barcelona, Spain). It is a hospital lab and the IgG4 tests/assays are not on listed their website, i.e., not publicly available. Our CRD had a conversation with him this week and got the information that his lab is doing a lot of IgG4 testing for pharmaceutical companies.        I did present the assay review in the clinical study team meeting. I think  the assay is OK for us to move forward . Washington University neuromuscular lab is a CLIA/CAP lab so there is CLIA-level quality assurance. For the next step, the team may ask Dr. Luis Querol's lab to do a confirmatory testing for the IgG4 autoantibodies by using archival samples. For the phase 3 study, we may switch to Dr. Luis Querol's immunofluorescence assay in his lab.       Again, when the study was initiated last year, the information about Dr. Querol's assay was simply not available. From the literatures and the public information, the option to go with Washington University neuromuscular lab was reasonable. From the assay perspective, these two assays, Western blot (Immunoblot) vs Immunofluorescence, are comparable to each other.     Need to follow up with the validation reports as PPD hasn’t got it and shared with me.      24Feb21:   Following up from the last clinical sub-team meeting,  to look at the autoantibody testing done at Jerome Deveaux lab in Montpellier that Dr. Querol suggested.   The assay format was Immunofluorescence. They also used ELISA in the paper. Dr. Jerome Devaux is affiliated with Institute for Neurosciences of Montpellier (J.D.), Montpellier University, Hopital Saint Eloi (Montpellier, France).  This seems to be an academic or hospital lab. We need to set up MSA with this university or hospital first. Then we can set up the contract (SOW, quoting, PO) with them. This process takes a long time.

The AE version is rarely used at this point because most trials monitor suicide-related adverse events since study start. The “suicide” question is included to capture a very unlikely event of a subject dying by suicide since the beginning of a trial and before the C-SSRS is introduced. Another way to record death by suicide on the C-SSRS is to endorse “death” under Actual Lethality on the Since Last Visit version.    ","Due Date":"","Outcome":""},"Other Information":{"Category":"Data Management","Owners":[{"name":"James Matta","type":"User"}],"studies":["PDY16744"],"Regions":[],"Roadmaps":[]}}},{"name":"Data tranfert specifications with ERT & PPD","createdAt":"2021-06-09T08:04:41.931Z","createdBy":"ENGEL Solene","lastUpdatedAt":"2021-06-09T08:04:41.931Z","lastUpdatedBy":"ENGEL Solene","closeDate":"","closedBy":"","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Action Status":{"Status":"In Progress","Escalated":"No","Reviewed":"not reviewed"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Action Description":"","Due Date":"","Outcome":""},"Other Information":{"Category":"Data Management","Owners":[{"name":"James Matta","type":"User"}],"studies":["PDY16744"],"Regions":[],"Roadmaps":[]}}},{"name":"CIDP foundation medical content for Website, Newletter","createdAt":"2021-06-09T08:09:04.390Z","createdBy":"ENGEL Solene","lastUpdatedAt":"2021-06-18T14:50:39.150Z","lastUpdatedBy":"Vidal-Thiell Pauline","closeDate":"","closedBy":"","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[{"comment":"first draft dated 14-June-2021, on-going review","commentedBy":"Vidal-Thiell Pauline","commentedAt":"2021-06-18T14:50:24.559Z"}],"fields":{"Action Status":{"Status":"In Progress","Escalated":"No","Reviewed":"not reviewed"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Action Description":"CIDP foundation medical content for Website, Newletter to share with CIDP foundation","Due Date":"","Outcome":""},"Other Information":{"Category":"Project Management","Owners":[{"name":"Pauline Vidal-Thiell","type":"User"},{"name":"Larry Orogun","type":"User"},{"name":"Miguel Alonso Alonso","type":"User"}],"studies":["PDY16744"],"Regions":[],"Roadmaps":[]}}},{"name":"SIVs planned dates in Canada to define","createdAt":"2021-06-09T09:04:54.928Z","createdBy":"ENGEL Solene","lastUpdatedAt":"2021-06-09T09:05:26.098Z","lastUpdatedBy":"ENGEL Solene","closeDate":"","closedBy":"","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Action Status":{"Status":"Not Started","Escalated":"No","Reviewed":"not reviewed"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Action Description":"","Due Date":"","Outcome":""},"Other Information":{"Category":"","Owners":[{"name":"Marco Lainesse","type":"User"}],"studies":["PDY16744"],"Regions":["North America"],"Roadmaps":["Canada"]}}},{"name":"SIVs date for sites 03 & 04 in US to define","createdAt":"2021-06-09T09:09:04.720Z","createdBy":"ENGEL Solene","lastUpdatedAt":"2022-03-22T11:01:23.315Z","lastUpdatedBy":"ENGEL Solene","closeDate":"2022-03-22T10:58:35.608Z","closedBy":"ENGEL Solene","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Action Status":{"Status":"Completed","Escalated":"No","Reviewed":"2022-03-22T00:00:00.000Z"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Action Description":"30June2021: Two last sites at risk for SIV before sep21: has been escalated on Tuesday 29June21,  RISK:   Dr Pasnoor  03– Has not reviewed or provided any comments to the original budget since 16Nov2020, when the budget was sent to the site    This site could have had a GL a long time ago if they has begun working on the initial budget.

CSC is in the process of defining the clinical distribution activities being managed by HP (i.e. IMP shipments) so that these activities can be transferred to Montpellier (MP) in ample time. As a result, there is obviously a huge impact on HP’s distribution within the EU of the CSC sourced PVC saline IV bags to those sites that cannot source them locally. I do not believe we can proceed with MP as the distribution site for these bags because: As previously discussed, MP cannot distribute these bags unless they are clinically labeled. Moving forward with MP as the distribution site will require updating the respective dossiers facilitating the clinical labeling (also previously discussed). Given the short shelf life on the CSC sourced bags, labeling them will consume precious time reducing their viable useability further. Question: If there are any affiliates/sites within the EU that can source the PVC bags, can that source be shared with other EU affiliates/sites? To recap, below are a few of alternative solutions proposed and their outcomes. Empty Glass Type 1 glass IV bottles: difficult to source. 50-60 ml polypropylene syringe: cannot be used if IV infusion requires dilution with saline. The diluted solution is not compatible with polypropylene. Question: To continue to explore this option, can the IV loading dose be administered un-diluted? Empty PVC IV bags: also difficult to source locally. So we circle back and ask for your assistance/suggestions in finding an appropriate solution. With the clock ticking, the sooner we can find a solution the better.    01Apr21:  From LSM in the Netherlands : Unfortunately I have just heard from our IPM there has been a catch and apparently the PVC bags from Spain are probably not usable. These PVC bags are only available with an adaptor for a vial and therefore cannot be used for reconstitution, as only a whole vial can be added. Our IPM is in contact with other IPMs across the CSUs trying to find a different vendor who can hopefully supply PVC bags, but I would like to reinforce to you how much work is going into sourcing these in Europe, and that this really is not normal or efficient. "},"Other Information":{"Category":"Clinical Supplies Activities","Owners":[{"name":"Francisco Corral","type":"User"},{"name":"Mostafa AZOUZI-ext","type":"User"}],"studies":["PDY16744"],"Regions":["Europe"],"Roadmaps":[]}}},{"name":"China 50ml PVC  saline bag sourcing issue","createdAt":"2021-02-25T14:32:14.747Z","createdBy":"ENGEL Solene","lastUpdatedAt":"2021-09-02T13:50:43.643Z","lastUpdatedBy":"ENGEL Solene","closeDate":"2021-09-02T13:50:43.946Z","closedBy":"ENGEL Solene","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Issue Status":{"Status":"Closed","Reviewed":"not reviewed","Escalated":"No"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Issue Description":"50 ml PVC bags couldn’t provide in China, and just confirmed the information from our procurement after investigation, could we purchase PVC bags from other country and import to China, consideration the whole shipment and importation and labelling process, the timeline very nervous, could pls take it as urgent case .if any information needed from my side, pls feel free to contact me.

Based on these internal discussions and our current portfolio of projects, a decision has been reached to hold start up for ACT16482 at this time. We understand that timelines are aggressive and we would like to be reconsidered in 2 months. If this is not feasible, we understand.         US CSU have approached Roswell Park: Hillengass, Levine: Usmani, Banner Health: Madan based on Sanofi team feedback.      ·       Dr. Hillengass from Roswell Park is interested so we are in the process of setting up a PSV with them.    ·      Dr. Usmani from Levine was not interested in the current protocol but was wondering if we have considered using anti-TGFβ agent (SAR439459) with a BCMA or GPRC5D directed bispecific antibody. He would be happy to discuss further. ·      Dr. Madan from Banner Health is in the process of completing a feasibility questionnaire.     Dana Farber: Dr. Nadeem, another site chosen for this study has still not identified a regulatory coordinator so we can move forward with SSU. I check with them weekly on the progress and as of Friday,  they are still interested in participating but do not have a regulatory coordinator assigned yet . Please note that we chose this site based on their stellar enrollment performance with TCD14079.

Puerto Rico Medical Center will work on a contract directly with Jeff Esham at Florida Cancer Specialists and get back to Sanofi with flight costs, hotel costs, and scanning activity costs so Sanofi can amend the PRMC contract.   PRMC to add FCS to the 1572 since they are performing the FDG and NaF Pet Scans. Plan is to perform them on 2 separate days.

Laura LeBeau, Keoys Coordinator has sent radiologist the link to the training as well as the questionnaire for completion. Sanofi will amend the contract: Identify PRMC site budget/contract language to be added for flight costs and hotel stay for patient and care giver, and reimbursement to PRMC for the scanning activities based on  their contract with Florida Cancer Specialist.     Option 1 is validated: If a patient is identified, we can immediately move forward with flying the patient from PRMC to Florida to have the NAF and FDG PET- CT scans performed.          Option 2: Pharmalogics to Provide NaF18 tracer to Puerto Rico Medical Center      Pharmalogics: PRMC and I met with Pharmalogics on 14-Jan-2021 to see if they can possibly provide the NaF18 tracer to PRMC.

To obtain reliable results especially for safety analysis.    In SS03 (Belantamab) starting from PA02, only one DL remains in phase 1 + a DL-1 in case of DLT. There is therefore a risk of having only 3 patients in dose finding if we don’t have DLT on the first cycle of the first three patients.    After discussion with the Stat team, it was recalled that it is mandatory to have at least 6 patients even in the absence of DLT (without DL-1).    In the latest version of the protocol a mention exists but it is not explicit. “The mTPI2 design is a Bayesian interval design that can be implemented in a simple fashion as the traditional 3+3 design,”    It was therefore decided during a meeting of 08Feb22 to submit this information to the next study committee meeting at the end of February so that a decision could be taken on the possibility of randomizing 3 additional patients in phase 1 to obtain 6 patients.

In addition it requires a general anesthesia and appointments on site are complicated ( During previous exchanges with the sites, it quite impossible to make an appointment for a BMA sample between randomization and the first TTT of the study)   - The sample to analyze the phenotyping for anti CD47 is only stable for 72 hours, all analyzes must be done during this short period of time.   - For SS06, analyzes must be carried out for anti CD47. But the sample must be taken before the TTT, therefore during the screening, when we will not know in which study the patient will be randomized.       Risk:   It will therefore be possible for an anti CD47 analysis to be carried out on patients randomized to SS01 or another study added later. this analysis is very expensive.       Questions:   Should we do a specific analysis of an SS without knowing if the patient will be in this SS? Where should this analysis be recorded in the protocol?

This baseline analysis is essential for the study  This sampling will be explained in the Master protocol because this procedure must be done during screening (pre TTT – Baseline)  The study team reserves the right to stop taking this sample after the IA of SS06 (30 patients) or anytime to avoid analyzing too many unnecessary samples  All stakeholders are aware that some samples taken and analyzed will be lost for analysis in case of randomization in the control arm (SS01) or in another sub-study which may be opened in the future in the controlled part.     This will be limited by the fact that randomization ratio will favor inclusion in SS06 vs SS01, and that no additional substudies are planned in the short-term."},"Other Information":{"Category":"Central Lab","Approvers":[{"name":"Elisabeth De Kermadec","type":"User"},{"name":"Alice Raffenne-Devillers","type":"User"}],"studies":["ACT16482"],"Regions":[],"Roadmaps":[]}}},{"name":"Timelines SS05 and 06 after FDA feedback","createdAt":"2023-09-07T15:58:35.045Z","createdBy":"Kuypers-ext Celine","lastUpdatedAt":"2023-09-07T16:03:15.386Z","lastUpdatedBy":"Kuypers-ext Celine","closeDate":"2023-09-07T15:58:35.252Z","closedBy":"Kuypers-ext Celine","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Decision Status":{"Status":"Closed","Date of decision":"2023-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","Escalated":"No"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Decision Description":"During A meeting we discussed the timelines and number of patient for the next SS05 and SS06 following the FDA feedback and the new version of the Protocols which will be signed on Sep 27.

Country allocation for SS05 and SS06 was not communicated at that time since the impact of the FDA type C meeting comments (dated 25Jul23) was still being discussed in order to find the most efficient way to move forward.   Regulatory confirmed on 04Aug23 that the SS04 CTA package was planned to be released by the end of August 2023 and the submissions would follow in September.    Protocol Amendment – SS05 & SS06  In order to answer the FDA requests from the FDA meeting in July 2023, amendments to the Master protocol, SS05 and SS06 were prepared. Signature of these amendments is planned for 27Sep23.    Submission strategy  The timeline between SS04 CTA package availability and SS05/SS06 CTA package availability was considered short enough to perform the simultaneous submission of the sub studies together according to the sub studies to be initiated per country:  Israel: SS04, SS05 and SS06 South Korea: SS04 and SS06    When deciding how to move forward, two submission strategies were discussed:  Sequential submission strategy - SS04 would be submitted 1st and the others would follow later when the CTA packages would be ready.  Local teams have confirmed that if sub studies are submitted sequentially, approval of the 1st sub study has to be obtained before the next one is submitted. This would mean about 6 months interval between submission of each sub study which could lead to considerable overall umbrella study delay.    Simultaneous submission strategy – submitting all sub studies together  Considering that FDA has approved SS04, once the new countries approve the respective protocol, the sub study can start.  Regarding SS05, an amendment has been implemented to answer FDA requests but there is still a risk that FDA would have additional requests. The simultaneous submission of all 3 sub studies in Israel could potentially suffer a delay if FDA has comments on SS05 that would lead to an additional amendment and would halt the review of SS04 and SS06.    The potential study start up delay mentioned above would affect SS04 recruitment in Israel towards the global end of the recruitment period. It was agreed to accept the risk and to proceed with simultaneous submission of the 3 sub studies in Israel.  "},"Other Information":{"Category":"Project Management","Approvers":[{"name":"Celine Kuypers-ext","type":"User"},{"name":"Elisabeth De Kermadec","type":"User"},{"name":"Paola Naggi","type":"User"},{"name":"Monica DRAGUS-ext","type":"User"}],"studies":["ACT16482"],"Regions":["Central"],"Roadmaps":[]}}},{"name":"ICF in eCRF","createdAt":"2023-10-06T09:12:12.994Z","createdBy":"Kuypers-ext Celine","lastUpdatedAt":"2025-08-21T14:58:47.611Z","lastUpdatedBy":"DRAGUS-ext Monica","closeDate":"2025-08-21T14:58:47.609Z","closedBy":"DRAGUS-ext Monica","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Decision Status":{"Status":"Closed","Date of decision":"2023-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","Escalated":"No"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Decision Description":"Many options exist in the ICF of the study (Screening and SS).

The patient most recently has exposure to a trispecific t-cell engager (CD38 x BCMA x CD3). Prof Quach was querying the requirement for a 12-month washout period prior to enrolment, given that T-cell engager half life is a lot shorter than the traditional CD38 monoclonal antibodies (e.g. dara and isa) and requested a conversation with the medical monitor to clarify. Mony Morisse, medical monitor, spoke with Dr Quach on the evening of Sunday 5th Oct (morning of Sunday 6th October in Australia) and agreed with Dr Quach’s decision to enroll this patient exposed to tri-specific CD3xBCMAxCD38 given the specificity of short half-life.

The signing of an agreement being a transparent way of documenting and indicating to the consortia that they can commence with the specified activity(ies) therefore ideally should take place upon completion of the agreement.     2) The Pre-study Agreement currently under draft is expected to be signed no later than the week of 8th February and the concern is that it may be delayed due to the possibility that the assessment may still be on-going at that time.     3) Given that the consortia have been very forthcoming with our request for assessment and with the limited scope of activities in the pre-study stage, it is unlikely that the assessment will not be completed before the finalization of the PSA.     4) In the unlikely event that the assessment is not completed before the finalization of the PSA, we agree there is minimal risk in proceeding with the signing first given the reputation and strong track record of the consortia and the project team’s knowledge of their capability and high quality of work.

(see email from Carine Bernard to BIG sent on Thursday 10 February 2022 at 17:19)      Patient fees:        For group’s sites contracting by groups:   The cost per visit, communicated to you (see attached) takes into account: - Cost per visit per patient – this amount is based on protocol procedures and represents the visit cost  - Overhead percentage  - Conditional procedure (98%) – for budget provisioning, we assumed that unscheduled visits/conditional procedures will increase the visit cost by 98%. This means that the cost per visit that provide to partners is a fully loaded cost, and no other fees will be added to this cost (as the unscheduled procedures are already in). The site should not invoice any extra-cost outside this fully loaded per visit fee. These figures (from Excel \"EFC16133_patient and site cost_summary shared with BIG on 21Jan22\", tab 1 and 2) will be used by the groups when contracting with their sites as a flat all-inclusive fee per visit. The only additional costs that should be in the contract are the site costs as per Excel \"EFC16133_patient and site cost_summary shared with BIG on 21Jan22\", (tab 1 and 4).      For group’s sites where Sanofi is contracting:   Sanofi will use their standard contract format where cost per visit is exclusive of conditional procedures and conditional procedures are itemized separately.  Sites invoices will be based on the visit cost + other procedure as they occur (Conditional procedures or unscheduled visits).      2. Site fees:        For group’s sites contracting by groups:   We agree on items and payment trigger that are mentioned here below:  Upon reaching the payment trigger, BIG will pay to the Group the applicable fees.  What the Group puts in the contract with their sites, is up to them and will depend on which activities are performed by the site or by the Group themselves (e.g. if the Group takes care of EC submissions for all their sites, they will keep the fee for the Group).

The patient will be blocked for being marked as eligible in RAVE EDC and no data would be sent to IRT for randomization (transfer of registration information between RAVE EDC and IRT).

Investigator being responsible for enrolling the eligible patients to the study. technical issue in the dataflow: IRT system cannot work independently, manual action from IRT will be needed if any update, increasing risks of randomization delays and burden for site and patients.   Preventive actions proposed to mitigate the risk of non-eligible patient:  Robust site training All I/E criteria listed on dedicated eCRF page (as per your standard) Eligibility confirmation question in IRT (Global Yes/No question, no duplicate with eCRF) Protocol deviations review through deviations reported by monitoring teams and your data cleaning process allowing appropriate actions (site re-training or site closure if quality concern)  Proposal of mitigation action for stratification error: to raise the stratifications questions through IRT to the site at the time of screening and to ask confirmation at the time of randomization. Per medical’s feedback on our stratification factors, stratification information should be available for site from screening.           "},"Other Information":{"Category":"IRT","Owners":[],"studies":["EFC16133"],"Regions":[],"Roadmaps":[]}}},{"name":"Statistical activities","createdAt":"2021-04-22T09:39:45.064Z","createdBy":"Despagnet Laurence","lastUpdatedAt":"2021-09-28T12:39:14.361Z","lastUpdatedBy":"Edel Adrien","closeDate":"2021-09-28T12:39:14.557Z","closedBy":"Edel Adrien","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Action Status":{"Status":"Completed","Escalated":"No","Reviewed":"2021-09-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Action Description":"Roles and responsibilities between EORTC and Sanofi to be clarified for statisticals activities: collaboration and potential duplicate activities to be assessed.","Due Date":"2021-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","Outcome":"As of 30Mar21: Discussions ongoing to optimize activities.

For the next Sanofi-BCT meeting/communication we plan to book 13 or 14 Jan 2022. RTM, BIG PM, Sanofi local team AUS/NZ, RTM manager (supporting purposes) and partners will be present.    We determined  the following topics for discussion:       POA: requirements. Local scope of work for parties; particularly in light of Sanofi ANZ being the local sponsor. (Partners comment: – We would favour a SOW to further understand our responsibility and commitments. As indicated above BCT would typically be listed as the local sponsor)  Legal and study logistics. How contracting will occur and managed locally. ((Partners comment: – relates to point 1 above. If BCT is the sponsor we will contract with our sites directly)  HA/EC submission responsibilities and timelines. (Partners comment: – Happy to speak further on this. Typically BCT coordinates the HREC submission for our national mutual acceptance (NMA) submission. Additionally we provide HREC support for independent sites that are not able to participate in the NMA submission)  List of sites. Communication with sites: expectations. ((Partners comment: – I aim to have the list of sites to you before Dec 24 th. Typically with BCT coordinated collaborative group studies BCT coordinates communication with participating sites in order to minimize confusion, although we acknowledge that in some cases (for example safety notification/reporting) direct communication with sites maybe required) Monitoring plan: feedback & discussion. (Partners comment: – Happy to speak further on the items I have flagged as requesting additional information)  IP management.     11Jan2022 status:    No feedback from partners on final list of sites (14 sites will be selected in Aus and 2 in NZ).

Indemnity and Insurance model: BCT-ANZ.  Meeting held between BCT and Sanofi ANZ last week to explore local sponsor. Global team cannot extend liability to collaborative group, therefore Affiliate (local Sanofi ANZ) is required to be the local sponsor and be responsible for the indemnification obligations of the sponsor toward patients. Local affiliates are included in Sanofi insurance program. This seems due to Sanofi policy (QSD-005425) and not for any legal reason.  Approach then needed is traditional whereby Sanofi is the sponsor and a POA in place to enable BCT to execute by way of agency powers. Not considered any change needed to the payment arrangement to the sites - to be made by BCT as per global arrangement. Helen (comments) - Use commercial sponsored template. Have POA between global and local Sanofi to allow party acting on Sanofi behalf to execute clinical trial agreements. Signature on indemnity documents (Maddy), Regulatory team to notify for TGA and make the Medsafe submission. The third party model, with BCT responsible for the site management & conduct of the study in ANZ, will be similar to that of a CRO for the Sanofi affiliate. Local communication plan to put in place. Local PM assigned by end Feb. Keep contact with Helen, Dmitry and Maddy. Worked successful in past. Standard documents to share. Informed consent forms - need to add Sanofi mandatory requirements per privacy as per local privacy principles. Although local agreement would be preferable with local Sanofi and BCT this is not the model. Global MSA in place between BIG, EORTC (GDPR), US group etc and Sanofi, no direct contractual link between Sanofi affiliate(ANZ) and BCT. BCT works with BIG per task orders. Task order to out in clauses about local Sanofi sponsorship. Need to ensure data privacy, where the data will be going such as vendors, this is required for the Informed consent. Local Sanofi team would need to review the consent template to ensure requirements Data management is done by EORTC.      Legal and study logistics. How contracting will occur and managed locally: Sanofi team, BCT-ANZ  Helen - Sanofi contract templates to be provided for AUS and NZ, work closely with BCT, use abode signature process. To document the process to follow in the local communication plan. Local Sanofi generic templates are mandated to be used. No negotiating over legal provisions, budget to be negotiated by BCT. BCT CEO looks over POA documents. Helen POA draft in place. Need to define all aspects including Sanofi global signatories and GST aspects such as to understand global process per pass through costs.      Final list of sites due by End Jan  Currently approx. 16 sites confirmed, 14 AUS and 2 NZ. 4 sites were unable to resource the study, challenging situation. Final list to be provided by BCT end of this week(by 04Feb2022). Sites have been contacted and had the chance to review the protocol and requirements. Back-up sites also identified. BCT to confirm they can cover the patient allocation with the number of sites and for the timeline, BCT are meeting tomorrow.      HA/Submission approval timelines:   The following dates for Australia and New Zealand were agreed in principle by BCT and to be entered in CTMS (IMPACT) by Sanofi (Dmitry)  Australia:   IRB/IEC Submission = 15-Apr-2022 1st IRB/IEC Approval = 15-Jun-2022 HA/CA Submission and Approval = 21-Jun-2022(our CA submission is simply an acknowledgment process, not an approval process which means there is no waiting for an approval) 1st Site Initiation Visit = 15-Jul-2022 First subject screened = 22-Jul-2022 First subject included = 19-Aug-2022   New Zealand:   IRB/IEC Submission = 15-Apr-2022 1st IRB/IEC Approval = 15-Jun-2022 HA/CA Submission 15-Apr-2022 HA/CA Approval 08-Jul-2022 1st Site Initiation Visit = 05-Aug-2022 First subject screened = 12-Aug-2022 First subject included = 30-Aug-2022  In terms of Covid-19 outbreak several actions On/off-site MV, tools and models would put in place by institutions, remote access to SD, submissions, policies of managed health and monitoring, and coordinated national RnR - details can be discussed in subsequent meetings.    BCT-ANZ next steps:   Set-up of local team - Tracy or Michelle to be allocated program leader to manage the operation aspect based on Workload, then May/June look at allocation of CRAs to start training ready for study activation. Sites ready towards July.. Expectation to closely partner with Sanofi partner Local study manager and have close contact. Communication also needed for CTMS updates, status and Contract updates to partner. Question (Heath): Does Sanofi require any particular qualifications/experience for BCT staff in MP or SOW? Answer: Not planned to have any pre-requisites or min experience in MP or SOW, CRAs will need to be fully trained per requirements incl vendors and systems and preferably experienced in Oncology trials. Quality oversight is expected, Sanofi Quality team is assigned to the study and CRA oversight expected. BCT usually has good structure of inducting new staff, long process of approx. 18months-2 years they are paired with experienced CRAs. Opportunity to add new staff in a study such as this.

Study team was informed, that additional submission will be planned to ECs in Georgia, if there is no available translation for PRO by the time of submission, however the translation is planned. That may cause to delay in FPS. Per vendor GSM feedback: Translation of PROCTCAE is done by another Vendor (not ERT) and as I mentioned if the translation of that questionnaire for Georgia will appear in future so then it need to be consider if this questionnaire should be included of course after earlier submission. But at this stage Vendor has not confirmed when they can have a ready translation.      Taiwan:  Taiwan team contacted all available sites and provided the following feedback/concerns (shared with BIG PM and study team):     The list of sites with comments from Taiwan team and feedback from sites was shared with Study team and BIG PM. Taiwan team proposed 10 sites (from 12 sites initially planned per feasibility) and per site’s feedback below only 19 subjects could be enrolled by provided sites, so there is a risk not to reach 36 subjects(planned target for Taiwan).  For 1 site: PI should be replaced(1581667). Concerns:  Limited patients pool:  >50% complaint about discomfort but most could tolerate AIs. Tamoxifen is not good comparator for post-menopausal patients. And pre-menopausal patients cannot get reimbursement in Taiwan for AI treatment. 25 slides are hard to be obtained, limited patients pool  Study design:  Annually Mammography is not accepted. As local practice, yearly CT for chest/abdomen/pelvis + bone scan are essential for disease monitoring. BYOD is not accepted by some sites. 2 sites ask Sanofi Taiwan provide devices to all subjects due to                                                                i.     Potential Risk of Patients personal information record by the ERT system                                                             ii.     SC will be unable to support patients for trouble shooting-lower the compliance rate, also create extra workload for SCs                                                            iii.     In Total Taiwan team asked, if it is possible to cover all subjects with ERT devices (not to use own devices), min 19 devices.     Sites are not sure if IRB/EC will approve or not approve the study, however still can submit it and see IRB/EC’s opinion. The concerns of design will prevent investigators to enroll subjects in Ameera-6 study.      17Feb2022: During RSM-GSM regular call it was decided, that RTM should not track country updates in details in control room, however LSMs and RSMs should update control room on each 2d and 4th Wednesday of the month on team updates page.

Edel and Excel file was posted in Study Sharepoint (Sanofi Restricted Area > 08 - GSM working area > 1st Baseline Enrolment Curve). File was presented to RSMs at GSM-RSM call on 27Jan22. RSMs to review/update data for their countries in the \"Enrollment by Country\" tab by 03Feb22. Concerns:   Adrien to confirm if we can have only study level baseline curve in Impact or RSM need to review the number of subjects: enrolment rate per country and update it the file on SP (time consuming and at this time we would not have validated data). On country level for group countries this should be provided by groups, however for some countries local teams even have not contacted by groups.      03Mar2022:  Not really relevant to have the baseline in IMPACT now. Waiting until full feasibility and final allocation from US. Until early April. Not to do the baseline. Now there is no baseline figures in IMPACT. Do not have the final allocation. Currently it can be visualized in excel file, not in IMPACT. There are very much uncertainties regarding the allocation, no numbers that make sense. No know how may patients and sites US will final provide. Patricia to discuss with Adrien and Rita number of subjects action pending. Not confirmation until mid March 2022. Re analyzed by Rita and send to BIG for validation. Best waiting  Rita new figures. BIG to provide feedback by mid of Mar 2022, Sanofi feasibility in US to be completed by end of Mar 2022. Then to complete figures and curves in Impact.     31Mar2022:   When feasibility list will be released it will be shared with Sanofi LSM - how to secure who is responsible of the curve as the sites were not chosen etc   We should use the numbers defined by Rita but need to be clear that the commitment is not similar than usual study. Action Morgane     28Apr2022:  No need to baseline site level now and team should focus on country event dates, SIV/enrolment curves. The data is still missed for some countries. All efforts to be made to have all data by end of April 2022 (except countries, which are not able to provide the curves data by this time). Decided to have baseline SIV/enrollment/event dats on country level by end of first week of May 2022.      13May2022:  All countries completed figures, validated by global and local study teams and requested to baseline the event dates, SIV and enrollment curves. Target to baseline global curves by 13MAy2022 EOB.    31May2022:  All countries are baseline, baseline have been shared internally and to partners.

Workgroup discussion: DM - Stat - Medical - GSM/RSM     Paper diary vs eDiary:  1st : considering the number of countries that requested a mobile/tablet for Clario we cannot assume that patients will use their own device (at least not the majority as initialy planned) 2nd: to transfer to an eDiary and keep efficiency/simplicity for the patients - investigation ongoing to manage an application within the same (Clario) device. point to be determined: is this Clario application acceptable on patient smartphone for those who will make this choice. 3rd: cost to be evaluated + 3 month set-up minimum after contract signature      Minutes of the meeting dedicated to eDiary held on the 22th of June 2022. Attendees: Morgane Bellachen, Guillaume Bégis, Andrea Jiang, Samia Guita, Khadija Benlhassan, Cyril Daveu, Nabile Haddad, Christine Devisme, Arnaud Magnier.    As Ameera-6 is a 5 years study, patient compliance may be an issue. In comparison with Ameera-5 study, in Ameera-6, time between visits is longer (3-6 months vs. 1 month) and patients have a cancer which is at a less life-threatening stage, therefore compliance may be lower.   For paper diary, the way of reporting IMP intake is not expected to have a significant effect on compliance. If case of an eDiary, need of a backup paper IMP diary, reconciliation to be performed at site.    eDiary data are not directly integrated in eCRF    An eDiary offers the possibility of setting a daily alarm to remind patient to take its medicine; this usually leads to an increase of compliance. If patient must fill on a regular basis its IMP intake and he/she forgets to do it, site could be informed of this and will contact patient. We need to note, that each option set up on an eDiary will have an additional cost. As an eDiary will be used more regularly than for the patient questionnaire, the device life could be shortened and may not last during the 5 years of the study, need to anticipate a cost for its replacement. Currently Clario is replacing with no extra cost the replacement of malfunctioning devices (information get after our call).    It has been agreed that having two different devices for the study, one for the questionnaire and one for the eDiary, is not desirable, therefore if an eDiary cannot to be installed on Clario’s device, an eDiary won’t be considered anymore.     eDiary could offer a real advantage when the disease state is closely monitored and linked to the IMP intake, like in diabetes. The question was raised if an eDiary with a daily registration could offer a better follow up of AE; but in this study AE may be due to a prolonged administration of the drug and it may be not possible to directly linked AE and doses taken.    Site staff are currently used to paper IMP and could find easier/more rapid to deal with paper IMP diary than an eDiary. eDiary more for patient compliance but may not make things easier for site staff.    If we are not going for an eDiary, need to re-evaluate the way of reporting missed doses; for ex by reporting missed doses per week or per cycle (and not over 3 or 6 cycles). This may lead to a better reporting of the exact days of missed doses, impact on compliance is however questionable.     Post meeting minutes following discussion with Khadija YHUEL (Vendor Excellence Team Leader – specialist of Clario). Attendees: Morgane Bellachen, Guillaume Bégis, Khadija Yhuel.    Clario could implement an eDiary for Ameera-6 but as they will need to work on a new software dedicated to our study, usually this takes 3-4 months (timeline seen with EDO studies). As Clario is already working on 3 new implementations for the study that take them already 6 months of work; eDiary may be available within 9-10 months on Clario’s side (then we ll need EC approval prior its use by patients). At the end of the process, half of patients could have been enrolled and would have to switch from the paper IMP to the eDiary.    Installing an eDiary developed by another vendor on Clario’s devices to speed up the process is not expected to be accepted by Clario or would be difficult to set up contractually. Khadija Y. confirmed us that having two different devices (one for patient questionnaire and the other one for eDiary) will be not convenient for patients and it’s not recommended.    From the experience of eDiaries for IMP intake with EDO studies, patients were not so compliant to fill their eDiary; at the end, they had to increase the time window for IMP intake recording not to have too many missing data (patients could fill their eDiary retrospectively but within less than 24h).     Estimated cost: At Sanofi, there is currently no comparable study that have a Clario’s eDiary. EDO have 3 studies with an eDiary that follow IMP intake with alarms/alerts but these studies involve much fewer patients and are shorter (example of ACT17207: 80 patients, 8 different languages, 1 year study duration). However, by transposing the costs for their study to our study, we can roughly estimate that the cost could be around $650,000.     Overall status on Clario: Clario is supporting 54 Sanofi’s studies; Study Team of each study experiences some issues with this vendor. The poor quality of service will not help implementing an eDiary for the study. Unfortunately, it isn’t possible to change a vendor in the course of a study.      Conclusion:  Long lead times for setting up an eDiary (at least 10 months in our situation) with Clario compromises the possibility of having one for the study. As we may have to keep a paper diary, we could think of making some modifications for better compliance. Suggestions are welcome and another meeting on this topic will be set up.     12Jul2022:  What is considered as patient compliant per definition? --> using first IMP dose and last IMP dose --> missed dose information required for statistics    Statistic to review with stat programmer --> continue the discussion in a separate discussion.

We need feedback from all countries on the above.    Could you please collect this information on a tracker and share this with me on an ongoing basis?    We really want sites driving the R&R strategy for this study and we also want to begin working on/prioritizing materials that sites are requesting so that they are available and ready for initial submissions. In addition, we need to assess if there is a need to potentially provision cameras to the sites.    Update: Cameras will be provided to all sites by the vendor. No need to collect feedback on color photography.       6/2 Updates: BR: no feedback yet as pending initiation of SSVs. US: 3 SSVs complete, no site feedback on R&R materials they are needing. CA: Inclu/Exclu criteria, mini-protocol, patient brochure, not allowed to advertise in the hospital or outside because patients will come from their referrals, any patient materials (i.e. water bottle, etc.) are also helpful. CL: 3 sites contacted have their own strategies for recruitment, however they are agree to receive any new material for this, in order to share with other physicians.    6/16 Updates: CA: no additional information outside of 6/2 updates. CL: no additional information outside of 6/2 updates. Not all PIs are interested in using multi-channel recruitment. RSM sent email to GSMs to confirm. BR: sites are a part of a public health and they have a huge database of patients. poster, and paper materials are preferred. Multi-channel recruitment is not preferred for at least 2 sites due to socio-economic profile of patient and also these are public centers. LSM will check for other 6 sites. website could be useful for some sites especially with younger population. US: During SQVs, sites have not provided any feedback regarding comfort items to be provided to patients. Couple of sites are requesting only electronic materials (email), request for approved study information to be posted to site website. US sites would not find comfort items to be useful.    6/30:    CA: Cannot provide materials to subjects unless they are collected back at the end of study. CL: Patient comfort items (i.e. pens, sunscreen, etc.) are allowed to be provided. Will be included in LSCR if it is possible. BR: Patient comfort items are allowed to be provided, list of items needs to be submitted to national IRB and should be available with initial CTA package. Will be included in LSCR if it is possible.

US:  Sites cannot agree to budget until final protocol is available in order to reconcile site budget against protocol. Medicare analysis cannot be completed without a final protocol and final CICF. 2 sites on ACT16105 and ACT16106 (betenacourt - 5/28 and babu - 6/18 SSV) were able to finalize budget and receive central IRB approval in 30-45 days. Concern that if some SIVs occur earlier then 75% of sites within 90 days will not be achievable. Not a lot of central IRB sites.

LSM will add reminder to send weekly email.  7/1  LSM comfirmed no update to event date, SIV or enrollment plan. FDA meeting pushed out to 21Sep2020 will not have an impact for site submissions.     7/14  The country event dates in IMPACT remain the same even though the final protocol has been delayed to 31Jul2020 due to 2 sites willing to work at risk, however; the remaining 48 sites are at risk and timelines for those sites could be delayed 2 weeks or greater depending on when local IRBs are scheduled to meet. Also, sites are not willing to work on SSU activities including budget and reg docs without a final protocol. RSM escalated to CSD and GSM 7/3 and 7/13.     8/4 FSIV, FPI, FPS remains the same. Once the SSU packages are sent out iCRAs will schedule a TC with sites and check to see if the projected GL dates assessed at SQV are still correct or update if they have changed. LSM will continue to evaluate SIV & Enrollment curves.    8/11 No update to enrollment or SIV curve at country level. Reg packages have been sent to sites selected- 30 sites total.

Betancourt - Reg pack and work order sent to site. Discussions with site on budget held on 10Aug2020. US SSU is working to identify additional sites that can be prioritized for rapid start up. Central IRB submission occurred on 05Aug2020, review WCG planned 12Aug2020          CA:  Event dates from operational feasibility/inato need to be updated in IMPACT and baselined. To be completed by EOB 19May2020. Once initial baseline is complete, revised planned dates are expected to be entered along with planned enrollment/siv curve using new CTA package release timelines.

Currently no known impact to enrollment, SIV, and event dates even with protocol delay to 31Jul2020. Need ICF, protocol, patient facing documents (diary, eCOA, R&R materials), patient card, etc. 5 sites will require english and french and 5 sites will need english only. Health Canada will require english documents only.              BZ:  HA Approval and Full regulatory approval date in IMPACT to be updated to 21Jan2020 to be aligned with global regulatory timelines presented at CTA KOM. 6/2 Date is updated. Full regulatory approval must be received before IMP and equipment can be imported to the warehouse. This is the reason why there is 30 days between full regulatory approval and First SIV. FPS is planned to occur within 5 days of First SIV.  6/2  7 months from CTA package release to first SIV. Normally 9 months. Will try and perform first SIV in Feb, but this will depend on CTA package release date and approval timeline from HA.

LSM to provide an email confirming event dates have been reviewed and any changes to RSM each Friday.       6/18    LSM confirm email each friday that country level event dates and enrollment plan has been reviewed and share any updates will be shared with RSM.     6/30  No change at country level for event dates, SIV, enrollment curves.     7/14  LSM will evaluate country level event dates to review if any changes with protocol delay to 31Jul2020 even with CTA package release remaining the same at 15Aug2020.     7/28  LSM confirmed no change to event dates. Site level event dates ,enrollment curves will be completed by end of week.           CL:  Timelines are up to date in IMPACT. HA Approval and Full regulatory approval are expected in 15Dec2020. First SIV will occur 15Jan2021. There is one month between full regulatory approval and first SIV because we need to wait for import -IMP clearance and this cannot occur before full regulatory approval is received. Recently EC approval has been obtained quicker than normal and it may be possible to achieve full regulatory approval prior to 15Dec2020. This will continue to be evaluated.  6/2 LSM informed that all countries are asked to review and confirm event dates in IMPACT on a weekly basis. LSM to provide an email confirming event dates have been reviewed and any changes to RSM each Friday.   6/17: LSM will send email RSM 19Jun20. 6/30: No change to event dates, SIV, and enrollment plan 7/03: No change to event dates, SIV, . Enrollment plan is going to be done once all site will be done when the definitive sites are selected 7/14  No change to event dates, SIV or enrollment plan even through final protocol has been delayed to 31Jul2020.

Simplified IMPD is sufficient, we don’t need to submit CoA.  Portugal: If CoA for Palbociclib tablets is available, we will submit it. In this case it is also acceptable to submit only when tablets are introduced in the study.  Denmark, Finland or Estonia- CoA is not needed for the submission is any of the NOAB countries  Italy: I confirm that CoA of the palbociclib  tablets   is not required for submissions in ITALY.  Poland- Previous arrangements are in force as per the enclosed email so no more action is needed due to switch from capsules to tablets.  Spain - local reg confirmation that CoA of the palbociclib  tablets   are still not required for submissions.  Netherlands, Germany, Czech R and Belgium: no needed CoA for tablets  France: Yes it’s totally acceptable for France to submit only when tablets will be introduced in the study. We will make a note when we will submit the initial dossier to explain the situation.  UK: We don’t submit CoAs to the MHRA, but the change from capsules to tablets is likely to require a change in labelling and the IMPD which should be submitted for approval prior to implementation if the change is considered to be substantial in scope.  China: If combination drug product is not approved in China, another CTA for this combination drug product need to be filed along with SERD CTA.If we really have no other choice but to switch for China, we can try to submit a variation during CTA stage but its approval may depend on the capsules registration status in China at that time. Our proposal is to ensure the capsule supply for China CTA in case tablets cannot be approved to be used for this study.    Australia: Nothing needs to be submitted to TGA for CTA, since it is a notification system in Australia. TGA doesn’t evaluate any clinical trial related documents. CSU to comment on whether CoA need to be filed to EC. No risk from GRA perspective if introduce the tablet form prior approval.  Korea: To submit amendment with PDR before the switch, if the tablet has been approved in US or EU, would be fine. It is best to include PDR in the CTA initial package.  Japan: there is no problem regarding switching dosage forms.  Taiwan: not an issue for import table form though not yet approved in TW. All IMP not in the market would require to submit CoA, and it would be mandatory to get HA’s approval prior the tablet import to TW.  Singapore: CoA for the study batch of a product is needed if it is imported into SG for use in clinical trial. If CoA cannot be provided during initial CTA application, I suggest to omit stating palbociclib tablets in the CRM-N as product to be imported in for trial use. We can submit CRM-N (as a CTA amendment) after initial HA approval only when CoA is available. Approval will take about 3 working days for CRM-N. But in case if palbociclib tablets are not registered/approved for use in Singapore, it can be imported as auxiliary clinical research material for clinical trial use. As defined by HSA, an auxiliary product (AP) is therapeutic product or medicinal product used for the needs of a clinical trial as described in the protocol, but not as an IP. For such product, the labelling requirements under section 3.2 of the attached guide should be followed (as attached).  Russia: Labels is required only for Import License (IL) application to Russian HA. For IL application we need CoAs/CoRs + labels for all imported products. If we submit the labels only for capsules, we will receive IL only for capsules. Need to submit a new IL application for tablets (after receiving appropriate Labels for tablets). IL application is submitted after getting an approval for the study (the timelines for study approval is 40 working days after CTA submission). No risk to introduce the table form prior on market approval, only to follow the above requirement.  Ukraine: Labels are required at the time of the protocol submission. It is acceptable to commit to the HA to submit the tablet labels later if study will be initiated with the capsules and will be switched to tablets later. if CoA and labels for palbociclib tablets will be missing in the initial CTA, we will not be able to indicate this dosage form in the initial Application Form and it will not be approved initially, since CoA is required for submission. A CMC amendment will be needed and will take take approximately 1.5-2 months for approval. No risk to introduce the table form prior on market approval, only to follow the above requirement.  Turkey: Label submission is not required during the initial CTA submission.  Canada: Per say the CoAs are not required for CTA filing in Canada; but we do need tabulated batch results for the investigative drug = SAR439859, or for modified comparator. We do not provide tabulated batch results for unmodified comparator. A change to the unmodified comparator: palbociclib capsule (Ibrance) to be switched to palbociclib tablet - no CoA or tabulated batch results are required.  United States: From Kandarp: In my opinion, it is not mandatory to be submitted to US FDA at the start if the study but will be needed before we switch. From John Gigantino, Global Regulatory: I believe they are planning to include the palbo tablets in the same dossier for the capsules. This will mean we will need the CofA at the time of the submission. I will check with Nadine T. to see if this is correct and get back to you.  Chile: Not required for initial submission.    Brazil: No need for regulatory /submission approval but it will be needed at the time of importation.

Therefore, the same rules apply to both IMPs.  1.2 SAR439859 and Letrozole are always allocated at the start of a cycle.  1.3 For each cycle, sites will be requested to confirm if Palbociclib needs to be allocated or not. If yes, sites will have the option to decrease the dose (if not already on minimum dose)     2. SAR439850/LETROZOLE OMISSION RULES 2.1 When all 3 IMPs are omitted, the next cycle will be delayed until the subject is ready to re-start one of the 3 IMPs. No cycle can be skipped; ie all cycles must be registered in the IRT and it is not possible for a subject to go from Cycle 5 to Cycle 7 (without registering Cycle 6) for example. 2.2 When only Palbociclib is omitted at the start of a cycle, the scheduled visit is registered as normal for SAR439850/Letrozole allocation. If Palbociclib is resumed during the course of the cycle, sites will register an unscheduled visit to allocate this IMP. At re-start, sites will have the option to allocate the same dose as previously or to decrement it (if not already on minimum dose) There is a limit of 2 unscheduled visits per patient during the course of the same cycle. 2.3 When SAR439850/Letrozole are omitted and a cycle starts with Palbociclib only: This scenario is considered as negligible and therefore is not built into IRT. (This is why decision has been made to always allocate SAR439859 and Letrozole at the start of a cycle). If this happens, it is acceptable for these 2 kits to be potentially wasted. Sites will keep those kits in their pharmacy and not give them to the subject. When the subject later resumes SAR439859/Letrozole during the course of the same cycle, those previously allocated kits can be dispensed (if they are still in good condition) or replaced."},"Other Information":{"Category":"IRT","Approvers":[{"name":"Dheepak Kanagavel","type":"User"}],"studies":["EFC15935"],"Regions":[],"Roadmaps":[]}}},{"name":"QLQ-BR45 free text questions","createdAt":"2020-10-23T09:15:36.656Z","createdBy":"Muller Antoine","lastUpdatedAt":"2020-11-20T10:00:02.650Z","lastUpdatedBy":"Muller Antoine","closeDate":"2024-12-03T11:59:15.409Z","closedBy":"Super Admin","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Decision Status":{"Status":"Closed","Date of decision":"2020-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","Escalated":"No"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Decision Description":"Decision to use the BR45 version without free text questions, as copyright holder has informed us that free text question was removed from the official questionnaire."},"Other Information":{"Category":"Project Management","Approvers":[],"studies":["EFC15935"],"Regions":["Central"],"Roadmaps":["Central"]}}},{"name":"Increase in number of patients","createdAt":"2020-10-27T11:04:06.358Z","createdBy":"Limbert Marie","lastUpdatedAt":"2020-10-28T12:13:12.601Z","lastUpdatedBy":"Limbert Marie","closeDate":"2024-12-03T11:59:15.419Z","closedBy":"Super Admin","linkedItems":[{"category":"Actions","name":"Impact of increase in number of randomized patients + amended protocol 3"}],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Decision Status":{"Status":"Closed","Date of decision":"2020-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","Escalated":"No"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Decision Description":"Decision has been taken during IDCC (on 22Oct20) to increase number of patients to be randomized in the study to 1066 patients (instead of 708).

Sylvie Assadourian attended the meeting, too.     Sylvie has pointed out that there exists complexities and challenges in implementing randomization with old/new set of strata on a site-by-site basis. The cost and timelines of implementing these changes are still awaited from the IRT vendor.     Biostats clarified that the patients randomized with 2-strata could still be included in to final PFS analysis. This could be done using manually allocating patients from 2-strata to 3-strata based on the DFI information available in eCRF. But prior to doing this, we need to secure an agreement with regulatory authorities (i.e, FDA). By avoiding the modification of strata in the randomization system, we could consider using eCRF data only to do analysis of sub-population by changing adjustment variable used in the primary analysis. But this approach could be criticized by regulatory authorities for not using IRT to ensure the balance of the arm within each level.     Considering all the above, the clinical team proposed to revert the previously-made changes made to an eligibility criterion. i.e., to enroll only patients who are sensitive to prior neo(adjuvant) endocrine treatment (SERM, AI ± CDK4/6 inh). By doing this, all enrolled patients would have a DFI >12 months, and the study will have a homogenous patient population who are endocrine sensitive (no recurrence while on within 12 months of completion of adjuvant ET) per ESMO ABC guidelines. This would also not require any modification in the stratification factors.     Thus, the team agreed to not modify the stratification factors of the study. And considering that the planned change in exclusion criterion is not urgent, study team will not proceed with this amendment #03 for now."},"Other Information":{"Category":"Medical Writing","Approvers":[{"name":"Dheepak Kanagavel","type":"User"},{"name":"Qianying Liu","type":"User"}],"studies":["EFC15935"],"Regions":["Central"],"Roadmaps":["Central"]}}},{"name":"Letrozole & Letrozole-matching placebo is provided  as tablet over-encapsulated","createdAt":"2020-12-08T08:02:01.848Z","createdBy":"Ducru Guillaume","lastUpdatedAt":"2020-12-10T17:00:46.589Z","lastUpdatedBy":"Ducru Guillaume","closeDate":"2020-12-10T17:00:47.701Z","closedBy":"Ducru Guillaume","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Decision Status":{"Status":"Closed","Date of decision":"2020-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","Escalated":"No"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Decision Description":"The pharmaceutical form of Letrozole is is a film coated tablet.

However After further discussions between Medical Operation and R&D management it has been decided to not implement SPET: The following arguments are supporting the decision:  - Protocol & ICF amendment: even though there is still ongoing discussions around this topic, the preferred option from medical perspective is to include this questionnaire in the protocol to get a clean documentation of it. For Ameera5 it comes late. Some workaround solution has been proposed (ICF only, other separate documents etc…) but not fully satisfied the team. Whatever the options, it means o to clarify how the data will be used (- and this is not clear, 2nd point below) o time and cost to get it implemented  - All questions around data analysis of the questionnaire is still pending and will need some time to get clarification on roles & responsibility. This may come late for Ameera 5 and we may not get used of the data collected.

No impact on patient safety   What would be the impact in term of Study Endpoints ?  Samples to be collected via Covance labkit are not linked to primary endpoint but to secondary and exploratory endpoints. Consequently there will not be any issue but the following recommendation has been done:      -Tumor slides: per SOW, slides should be freshly cut before shipment (if no block shipped). So, sectioning should be kept to be performed close to shipment, rather than cut store the slides.      -Pregnancy test should be performed at each visit using another pregnancy test with the same sensitivity. However no deviation will have to be reported if site pregnancy tests (with sensitivity 25mIU/mL ) are used.      In conclusion a patient could be randomized and perform visit (applicable to all visits) without the collection of Covance labkit (but pregnancy test are mandatory), there is no patient percentage restriction at the moment but the studyTeam will follow this issue on case by case basis.       In such cases, Local team to alert global   team in advance of the visit and obtain approval from SMM/GSM before to proceed   with patient visit.

Local team are re-explaining the re-supply strategy to sites and try to negociate with them that the specific restrictions are not implemented for our study. Impact is been assessed by local team.    30 MAR 2021 CT-fast results:  The batches that are now being manufactured have sufficient shelf lives (18-24m). Expiring batches can be replaced with more recent batches in a timely manner. (this is only recently the case for this trial. It was not going to be possible a few months ago). The IRT isn’t built to handle the constraints on a site per site basis. It is possible to change on a country level. Meaning, we are forced to implement the most constraining rule to all Chinese sites to avoid errors. As a consequence there will be a higher loss at China sites and depot resulting in additional IMP need (+5300 kits) and additional shipments. Estimated additional cost = 6 Million Euro. This cost is mainly driven by Palbociclib kit which cost around 3500 euro’s per kit to source.     Is it possible to exclude the most constraining sites? If not, we need to look into updating the IRT and add the constraints only to the applicable sites.     31 MAR 2021 The site constraints and additional costs has also been escalated to supplies upper management. CSCO management doesn’t accept an additional cost of 6 million and Chinese sites shouldn’t be managed any differently.

This is expected to improve acceptance of parents to enroll their child in the study while not jeopardizing the interpretation of the study results. The serotype specific IgG concentration, as well as the Anti-rotavirus serum immunoglobulin (Ig) A Ab concentrations, Anti-pertussis (PT, FHA, PRN, and FIM) Ab concentrations, Anti- diphtheria toxoid Ab concentrations and Anti- tetanus toxoid Ab concentrations will not be available at baseline for the infants enrolled after the implementation of the protocol amendment. Therefore, the following endpoints, in addition to the Geometric mean concentration, will be evaluated only for the infants enrolled as of the date of the protocol amendment #3 implementation: o Serotype specific IgG concentrations ratios (Post Dose 3 / Pre Dose 1) o Anti-rotavirus serum IgA Ab concentrations with ≥ 3-fold rise over baseline  All the other endpoints will not be impacted as are not linked to baseline titers.  - Flexibility in the administration of the hepatitis B vaccine as concomitant vaccine in the study; this vaccine may be administered at the time of the study visits but would not be a mandatory vaccine as part of the study. This will allow more sites located in Ontario to contribute to enrolment as local guidelines (1) include Hepatitis B vaccination from Grade 7 only. The infants enrolled in the US may or not have received a first dose of Hepatitis B vaccine at birth; this will increase the pool of eligible subjects.   - Addition of clinical sites located in Honduras. Enrolment capabilities in potential clinical sites would significantly help in completing this study in the coming months, with a maximum target of 50% (350) infants enrolled in this country."},"Other Information":{"Category":"","Approvers":[{"name":"Treyci Ruiz","type":"User"}],"studies":["PSK00008"],"Regions":[],"Roadmaps":[]}}},{"name":"COVID 19  study in pregnant women: babies not possible to enroll in PSK08","createdAt":"2021-07-05T07:44:57.236Z","createdBy":"Pouzet Catherine","lastUpdatedAt":"2021-07-05T07:44:57.236Z","lastUpdatedBy":"Pouzet Catherine","closeDate":"2024-12-03T11:59:17.510Z","closedBy":"Super Admin","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Decision Status":{"Status":"Closed","Date of decision":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","Escalated":"No"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Decision Description":"Pfizer is running a large global COVID-19 Vaccine study In Pregnant Women.

The NIMP was provided by Sanofi Were NIMPs relabeled for the study? No  the number of doses at site vs used? See above the number of doses. I am following with the site to confirm how many were used.   The approximate timelines when these products were used? I am following with the site to confirm how many were used.   who and when this information was escalated? I, Hector Suarez, raised the issue on January 19th. We were trying to have the site acknowledge receipt of the NIMP. The site was reporting that NIMP was never received and after investigating further the SC found out that it was received/used by the private practice. Below is the site response:   From: Amy Martin amartin@javararesearch.com   Sent: Wednesday, January 19, 2022 3:07 PM  To: Suarez Molano, Hector /US/EXT Hector.SuarezMolano@sanofi.com   Cc: Nicole Larios nlarios@javararesearch.com   Subject: PSK00008 8400137 Escabosa    Hector,    The office manager at Dr. Escabosa’s practice was able to determine that the shipment was received by their staff and was merged into their office vaccine stock and was used. She would like an invoice and would like to pay for what they used. The package was addressed to “customer ship to” Bayside Pediatrics, it did say “customer contact” Amy Castellano but they are unable to determine if that was able to be seen on the package as they only have the packing slip now and not the label on the package. Also, Amy Castellano left Javara prior to the shipment being dispatched.    Apologies for the mistake. Please let me know what we need to do to get IMP and IP.    Thank you,    Amy Martin, RN    14 Feb2022_Christine-    Even if these were marketing products, Sanofi Pasteur remains responsible of the accountability of any product provided for a study conduct.    If not already logged in, a protocol deviation should be captured in CTMS and the PI should inform the IRB.    In addition to the requested information below, it should be also confirmed that the 3 marketed products were bought in the US. The site should list the subjects who receive the NIMP for proper safety follow-up. Once all the information is collected, I will confirm the investigation panel implementation.    Please come back to me as soon as possible with the expected information. 1 Mar 2022_Hector Provided Catherine the CAPA from the site 1 Mar 2022_Thomas asked  We need information from the site on the product used:   What was the product information : Lot Number, Exp Date Did they were bought in the US market?  Hector responded-   NIMP was provided by Sanofi. I do not have information on where it was bought. Below is the NIMP information form IRT as far as lot number/expiration date..

From the reading of the emails and the CAPA Form, there was no “Deliberate deception” meaning that it was not done on purpose and intentionally. So I confirm that no investigation panel has to be initiated.    However, I would recommend to complete a Storyboard to enable the full reconstruction of the event.  To help in identifying the root causes and impacts, additional details have to be retrieved to fill in some gaps related specially to the sponsor processes. For example, how and why this situation occurred? Why was it reported late after the shipment? Was it preventable? Is there any deviation in the IMP management?     Feel free to contact me for clarification or support to complete the storyboard."},"Other Information":{"Category":"Monitoring","Owners":[{"name":"Denise Lopez","type":"User"},{"name":"Maria Torres","type":"User"}],"studies":["PSK00008"],"Regions":[],"Roadmaps":[]}}},{"name":"Stage 1_Antibiotics reported after V2","createdAt":"2022-03-31T12:01:28.573Z","createdBy":"Pouzet Catherine","lastUpdatedAt":"2023-03-27T08:47:41.475Z","lastUpdatedBy":"Pouzet Catherine","closeDate":"","closedBy":"","linkedItems":[{"category":"Actions","name":"Issue_Antibiotics reported after V2 stage 1_How to  present in CSR"},{"category":"Actions","name":"Issue_Antibiotics reported after V2 stage 1_How to proceed"},{"category":"Actions","name":"Issue_Antibiotics reported after V2 stage 1_ensure this can be avoid"}],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Issue Status":{"Status":"Open","Reviewed":"not reviewed","Escalated":"No"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Issue Description":"Stage 1_Antibiotics reported after V2","Impact":"Medium","Outcome":""},"Other Information":{"Category":"Data Management","Owners":[{"name":"Data Manager","type":"BusinessRole"}],"studies":["PSK00008"],"Regions":[],"Roadmaps":[]}}},{"name":"Puerto Rico Power Outage","createdAt":"2022-04-12T15:45:14.939Z","createdBy":"Lopez Denise","lastUpdatedAt":"2022-06-01T08:30:59.846Z","lastUpdatedBy":"Pouzet Catherine","closeDate":"2022-04-12T15:45:14.997Z","closedBy":"Lopez Denise","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Issue Status":{"Status":"Closed","Reviewed":"2022-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","Escalated":"No"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Issue Description":"on 7 Apr 2022, the Clinical Study Management members were notified of a Power grid outage in Puerto Rico.

Although our sites were actually more active as site 2760003 pre-screened the first 6 patients. Waiting for our 3rd patient to be screened and randomized.    Spain: Sites are performing pre-screening visits however, the CEACAM5 positives are for those patients that are not progressed yet. For your information, we received yesterday the feedback from site 7240006 (including 7240106) with the reasons why they are inactive. They are as follows: • Docetaxel as monotherapy without Nintedanib is another limiting factor since this is not the current standard therapy. • Patients with gene mutation (e.g. EGFR) normally are not treated with ICI as it is not recommended (there is other therapeutical options better). However, per protocol, it is mandatory that they have received it (together with platinum chemotherapy). • Patient with KRAS mutation are being treated with KRAS inhibitors (clinical trials or out) and this maybe another limiting factor (In my opinion, according to study tip 1, these patients are eligible).    Italy: there are no local factors impacting patient recruitment. Currently, we have 10 patients who are CEACAM5 positive but pending PD. So the delay is linked to patient status.    Netherlands: Based on the screening activities, we have been unlucky to have lost about half of the patients. Therefore we are somewhat behind on randomisations. Fortunately, we heard today that one one of the prescreenings is positive, so hopefully this will lead to a randomisation this month. Also, another potential pre-screening (again at site 5280005, seems they’re picking up the slope again). The risk we do know of is that site 5280004 could potentially have a decrease on study activities because one of the nurses retired and has not yet been replaced.    France: No local factors have been identified that may slow recruitment.     Poland:  Issues/situation related with pandemic of COVID-19, limited availability of site staff for the study; No eligible patients due to change of inclusion criterion I02 by Amended Protocol 01 (dd 27Sep2019)- previous immunotherapy is mandatory for enrollment while at the time when feasibility and site selection was performed, immunotherapy was not mandatory by Protocol;  Amended Protocol 01 decreased the number of eligible patients but due to the change in drug reimbursement programs in Poland and the possibility of treatment with 4 ICI drugs and chemo-immunotherapy (platinum + ICI) in 1 L from January 2021 - there should be more eligible patients; however median time to progression should be considered - depending on treatment and patients’ profile - approx. 7.5 for pembrolizumab. Such patients should appear in the 2nd half of the 2021 year.     Bulgaria – the overall recruitment rate is according to the plan, even exceeded for May 2021 in terms of screened patients. There are 15 positive CEACAM5 patients but they were tested during their current treatment and any of them have progressed so far. As a consequence they cannot be screened at this moment.    Romania – the overall recruitment rate is below the plan, the pre-screening activities is not as expected. Site 6420006 was closed on 28 May 2021 due to lack of any pre-screening activities since the SIV. Two new sites will be selected, one in June and one in July 2021. The sites will be submitted to the authorities as amendment and we estimate that the approval to be obtained in Sep-Oct 2021. Main site feedback: the patients availability at their Oncology departments decreased a lot with more than 60-70 % since pandemic started. The investigators have already contacted their oncology specialist colleagues and asked for referrals. Even the selected sites are main Oncology hospitals, the patients that could be eligible for our study are not easily to be found. In addition for low activity could be also the high pre-screening failure rate that demotivates the investigators, even this was known from the feasibility timepoint."},"Other Information":{"Category":"Project Management","Owners":[{"name":"Mark Skinner","type":"User"}],"studies":["EFC15858"],"Regions":["Europe"],"Roadmaps":[]}}},{"name":"ERT vendor tablet stolen from site 3480007","createdAt":"2022-10-24T13:36:22.088Z","createdBy":"Skinner Mark","lastUpdatedAt":"2023-03-20T14:31:37.370Z","lastUpdatedBy":"Canals Eva","closeDate":"2023-03-20T14:31:37.475Z","closedBy":"Canals Eva","linkedItems":[{"category":"Risks (SRMP)","name":"ePRO - issues with tablet at site"}],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Issue Status":{"Status":"Closed","Reviewed":"2023-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","Escalated":"No"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Issue Description":"The ePRO tablet was stolen from site 34800007 (Müller).

However, we are trying that sites use Firecrest tool to make it easier for them to capture all trainings required as per protocol.     ADI log created to document how training it's done for the countries that are not implementing Firecrest for Training:    Israel - Site 3760003: Site will perform all the training outside the Firecrest system and will sign training certificates.The site use a training log to document all their training. Topic specific training logs (protocol amendments, new IB etc.) are uploaded to VV and filed in ISF once all required staff are trained and signed the log. Ongoing training log (for new comers) is signed when needed (new site staff) and is uploaded twice, at the beginning of the study (after SIV) and at the end. This is an ongoing log uploaded even in between from time to time.  US sites: US sites are using paper training records (site training logs) to document training for this trial. Copies of the paper training logs are obtained and filed in the ISF and Veeva.  EU region countries and sites not using Firecrest are documenting their training using the Sanofi Site Training Log which is filed in the Investigator Site File.  Australia: a local training matrix is maintained based on the global study matrix which is then used to prepare training log templates for sites. The log and the relevant training materials are provided to the sites. The completed training log is filed in TMF and ISF accordingly.  China: study related training is recorded in the training log which is maintained in the ISF at each site."},"Other Information":{"Category":"Project Management","Approvers":[{"name":"Giovanni Ortiz","type":"User"},{"name":"Mark Skinner","type":"User"},{"name":"Ulises Morales","type":"User"},{"name":"Sarah James","type":"User"}],"studies":["EFC15858"],"Regions":[],"Roadmaps":[]}}},{"name":"eCOA study tips","createdAt":"2023-05-09T11:26:46.418Z","createdBy":"Canals Eva","lastUpdatedAt":"2023-05-09T11:26:46.418Z","lastUpdatedBy":"Canals Eva","closeDate":"2023-05-09T11:26:46.952Z","closedBy":"Canals Eva","linkedItems":[],"discussions":[],"fields":{"Decision Status":{"Status":"Closed","Date of decision":"2023-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","Escalated":"No"},"Detailed Information":{"Sub-scope":["Not Applicable"],"Decision Description":"eCOA study tips created to prevent the eCOA questionnaires from being completed after drug is administered.
